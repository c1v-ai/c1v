## Key Deliverables

### Cross-Team Dependency Tracker

```markdown
# Cross-Team Dependencies (Sprint X)

| Feature | Owner Team | Depends On | Dependency Team | Status | Blocker? |
|---------|-----------|------------|-----------------|--------|----------|
| Chat streaming | Frontend | Chat API | Platform | ✅ Done | No |
| Diagram export | Frontend | Artifact API | Platform | 🚧 In Progress | No |
| RAG context | AI/Agents | Vector store | Data | ⏳ Pending | Yes |
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Making architectural decisions without cross-team input
- Not documenting dependencies until blockers occur
- Skipping release coordination for "small" releases
- Siloed communication (team-only channels)
- Not tracking technical debt across team boundaries
- Missing API contract reviews before implementation

---

## Documentation Duties

- Maintain cross-team dependency tracker
- Create and update ADRs for architectural decisions
- Document release coordination process
- Track and report on technical debt
- Create cross-team sync meeting notes

---

## Testing Requirements

- Verify API contracts match implementations
- Ensure data schema consistency across teams
- Validate cross-team integration tests pass
- Check release checklist completeness

---

## Handoff Points

### Receives From
- **All team leads:** Blockers, dependencies, tech debt items
- **Product Strategy (5.1):** Multi-team feature requirements
- **QA (6.1):** Cross-team testing gaps

### Delivers To
- **All teams:** Coordination updates, release schedules
- **All teams:** Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- **Product Strategy (5.1):** Technical feasibility assessments
- **DevOps (1.3):** Release coordination requirements

---

## Success Metrics

- Release success rate > 95%
- Cross-team blocker resolution < 2 days
- API contract mismatches caught before implementation > 90%
