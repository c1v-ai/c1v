This is a first pass at the deliverables that need to be completed in order to satisfy the
“analysis”. Some are broken down further. Some aren’t even connected in yet. It is clear
already though that some structure is beginning to take shape but that most, if not all, of
these will have to be explored further.
Notice that boxes aren’t placed precisely. They’re most likely going to be added to /
moved around later anyways.

Just a little bit of organization. We noticed that we’re going to need as part of the list of
panels, cost estimates for most, if not all, all of panel types we investigate (unless
maybe a panel type is really bad in some other way and its cost isn’t worth looking
into.) So we moved the cost estimates and moved under the list.
We may find we want to move it again later and that’s certainly okay. This is still a very
rough, just get the ideas down on paper, level of work.

Whether to repeat this node for each higher-up-the-branch-node, or connect this
node to both higher-up-the-branch-nodes, as is done here, depends on the
situation. Most of the time you’ll want to repeat the node, but here we believe
that both higher-up-the-branch-nodes’ needs can be easily met at the same time
while addressing this node so its okay we didn’t repeat this node.
Said another way, the person who does the “Research Government Websites” task
can meet both the “Determine Time Periods” and “Qualification Needs” at the
same time more easily than if you asked two people to address “Determine Time
Periods” and “Qualification Needs” separately.

And now, you’re done! Well at least well enough to get started with the next steps
of your work, and assigning tasks among team members. Now is a great time to
translate all of your slides into a timeline. You may likely find a few more tasks /
deliverables, performance criteria, needed data and questions in doing so as you
review your work here.
Check out the Timeline Guide on how to create a timeline. There is some overlap in
the themes and steps in the timeline guide with what is discussed in this guide, and
so you may be able to replace some timeline Steps (such as determining subtasks)
with the work that you have already done here.
You could also translate your question tree here to a PERT Chart or you can combine
your question tree into one large complete one and possibly color code it as well.
Either way, make sure you also read Defining Deliverables and all of its Tips section
so you’ll create your own question tree as effectively as possible.
