Defining Scope
Checklist
Instructions:
You need to identify the operations your system must perform in a variety of use case
situations.
These steps help you create a context diagram which will show the interactions of your
system with other elements. With the help of your context diagram, you then will be able
to create a list of use cases your system can perform, and a list of the elements and
stakeholders that will interact with your system. Check off each step as you complete it.
