Start with your “System” in a box
Your System
And place a dashed box
around it to symbolize your
System’s boundary
For the purposes of this example, we’ll assume your System is some kind of car-like vehicle
Dr. David R. Schneider 2016

Then start listing things your “System” has to interact with…
Roads
Other

…and place them in their own boxes…

This will help you stay focused on the interactions
with other things without committing to what
your System is/has structurally
Try trusting the tool and learn about its
value, before trying to break the tool.

Being thorough in your Context Diagram can be time consuming and even feel tedious if
you’re not used to using this tool. But there are common ways to break up the work
After you have done some initial work (as shown in slide 12) and you want to explore
parts of the diagram further, this becomes a great time to start to split up the work with
your teammates. Each person can then create there own context diagram(s) for the parts
they explored.
You can try to combine them all together later if you want, but at least recognize which
outer boxes show up in multiple teammate’s work and compare the interactions
discussed in all teammate’s work to help everyone have a clear idea of the interaction
needs.
