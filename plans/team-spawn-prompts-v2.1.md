# Team Spawn Prompts — v2.1 Amendment (c1v MIT-Crawley-Cornell)

> **Purpose:** Copy-paste-ready `TeamCreate` + `Agent` invocations for v2.1 Waves A + B + D.
> **Master plan:** [`plans/c1v-MIT-Crawley-Cornell.v2.1.md`](../../plans/c1v-MIT-Crawley-Cornell.v2.1.md)
> **Predecessor (v2):** [`team-spawn-prompts-v2.md`](team-spawn-prompts-v2.md) — 12 teams, 47 agents, ✅ COMPLETE 2026-04-24 (`synthesizer-wave-4-complete`)
> **v2.2 stub (deferred):** [`plans/c1v-MIT-Crawley-Cornell.v2.2.md`](../../plans/c1v-MIT-Crawley-Cornell.v2.2.md) — Waves C + E spawn prompts will land there
> **Created:** 2026-04-25
> **Author:** Bond
> **Status:** ✅ FIX-UP SWEEP APPLIED 2026-04-25 — all 21 critique-iter-1 issues + David's 5 R-v2.1 rulings resolved. `scripts/dispatch-helper.ts` shipped (8/8 tests green). `plans/post-v2.1-followups.md` seeded. D-V21.24 verified in master plan. Ready for Dispatch Wave 1 pending David's go-ahead OR optional critique iter 2.
> **Scope:** v2.1 ships **Waves A + B + D only**. Waves C (Crawley typed schemas + eval harness) and E (KB runtime architecture rewrite) are deferred to v2.2 — preserved-but-marked-deferred in the master plan, NOT spawned in v2.1.
> **Wave A ↔ Wave E handshake:** `lib/chat/system-question-bridge.ts` (transport) ships in v2.1 (TA1); `surface-gap.ts` (Wave-E producer) does NOT. The contract pin (`nfr_engine_contract_version: 'v1'` envelope on `GENERATE_nfr` / `GENERATE_constants` outputs) is honored in v2.1 so v2.2 can swap engine internals without a re-edit.

## Team inventory — v2.1 5-team roster

| # | Team slug | Wave | Agents | Lead subagent_type | Spawn prompt |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TA1 | `c1v-runtime-wiring` | A | 6 | backend-architect | **This doc §TA1** |
| TA2 | `c1v-synthesis-ui` | A | 6 | ui-ux-engineer | **This doc §TA2** |
| TA3 | `c1v-cloudrun-sidecar` | A | 4 | devops-engineer | **This doc §TA3** |
| TB1 | `c1v-hardening` | B | 5 | cache-engineer | **This doc §TB1** |
| TD1 | `c1v-apispec-iter3` | D | 4 | langchain-engineer | **This doc §TD1** |

**Total: 5 teams, 25 agents, 2 dispatch waves.**

Per-team role coverage (mandated):
- **QA / verifier (every team):** `qa-engineer` agent gates that team's exit criteria from v2.1 and tags `t<slug>-wave-<N>-complete` on green. Non-fix verifier — log failures, surface, do NOT auto-fix.
- **Documentation (every team):** `documentation-engineer` agent updates README / CLAUDE.md / inline JSDoc / runbooks scoped to that team's surfaces. TB1's docs agent additionally writes the v2.1 release notes + plan closeout (folding the v2 `plan-updater` role into TB1 since TB1 is the last team to ship in the v2.1 cycle).

Per-team subagent_type composition:
| Team | Backend | DB | LangChain | UI/UX | Data-viz | DevOps | Cache | Obs | QA | Docs | **Total** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TA1 | 1 | 1 | 2 | — | — | — | — | — | 1 | 1 | **6** |
| TA2 | — | — | — | 3 | 1 | — | — | — | 1 | 1 | **6** |
| TA3 | 1 | — | — | — | — | 1 | — | — | 1 | 1 | **4** |
| TB1 | 1 | — | — | — | — | — | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | **5** |
| TD1 | 1 | — | 1 | — | — | — | — | — | 1 | 1 | **4** |
| **Total** | **4** | **1** | **3** | **3** | **1** | **1** | **1** | **1** | **5** | **5** | **25** |

## Dispatch rules

1. `TeamCreate` fires first; `Agent` calls in the immediately-following message. Both `TeamCreate` and all `Agent` calls for a single dispatch wave fire in **one coordinator message** to maximize parallelism.
2. One `Agent` call per teammate → parallel spawn unless an explicit `blocks` field forces sequencing (e.g. `migrations-and-agent-audit` blocks all other TA1 agents per EC-V21-A.0).
3. Teammates reference each other by `name`, never by agentId.
4. Permissions for every `subagent_type` listed above already exist in [`.claude/settings.json`](../settings.json) allow-list (verified 2026-04-25).
5. **Skill attachment mechanism:** `inline_skills: [...]` fields in spawn prompts below are documentation for humans reviewing the plan. At actual dispatch time, Bond translates each entry into literal `Skill('X')` invocation instructions via the canonical translator at [`scripts/dispatch-helper.ts`](../../scripts/dispatch-helper.ts) (handoff Group D / Issue 22 — `composePrompt({agentName, subagentType, inlineSkills, promptBody})` prepends `CANONICAL_SKILL_INJECTION_HEADER` to every Agent prompt body). Per-team verifiers MUST assert every spawned Agent prompt passes `hasCanonicalInjection()` — FAIL on missing header. Tests at [`scripts/__tests__/dispatch-helper.test.ts`](../../scripts/__tests__/dispatch-helper.test.ts).
6. **HARD-DEP tags:** Any agent with `HARD-DEP on <tag>` in its guardrails blocks at dispatch if the tag is absent from `origin/main`. Bond verifies via `git tag --list` before issuing the Agent call. v2.1 HARD-DEPs:
   - TA2 / TA3 SOFT-depend on TA1 internal commits (project_artifacts table, langgraph-wirer); coordinated via `name`-based blocking inside the same dispatch wave, NOT via tags.
   - TB1 HARD-DEPs on `ta1-wave-a-complete` + `ta2-wave-a-complete` + `ta3-wave-a-complete` (Wave-A gate; TD1 not gating).
   - TD1 has no HARD-DEPs (parallel with Wave A; independent codepath).
7. **Reference-from-master-plan:** Every team's `context.authoritative_spec` points at the relevant section of [`c1v-MIT-Crawley-Cornell.v2.1.md`](../../plans/c1v-MIT-Crawley-Cornell.v2.1.md). Decision IDs (`D-V21.NN`) and exit-criterion IDs (`EC-V21-<wave>.NN`) are the canonical lock points; spawn-prompt deliverables map 1:1 to ECs.

## TA1 — c1v-runtime-wiring (Wave A)

**Scope:** Per-tenant LangGraph wiring of the 6 already-shipped T4b/T5/T6 agents into runtime nodes (D-V21.01 A2 TS-native). New `project_artifacts` Drizzle table with RLS from day-one (D-V21.04). EC-V21-A.0 preflight: 0011 migration collision reconciliation + agent fs-side-effects audit + canonical `intake-graph.ts` path verification + canonical `METHODOLOGY-CORRECTION.md` path resolution. Open-question chat-bridge transport (`lib/chat/system-question-bridge.ts`) + M2 NFR / hoq / fmea-residual emitter extensions per EC-V21-A.4. Atlas runtime ingest fix (`scripts/ingest-kbs.ts` path correction + Phase B re-run unblock) per EC-V21-A.8. Wave A ↔ Wave E contract pin (`nfr_engine_contract_version: 'v1'` envelope on `GENERATE_nfr` / `GENERATE_constants` outputs).

**Dependencies:** No external HARD-DEP. Internal sequencing: `migrations-and-agent-audit` agent runs FIRST and blocks all other TA1 agents until EC-V21-A.0 closes. Other TA1 agents then run in parallel.

**Honors:** D-V21.01, D-V21.04, D-V21.13 (defer Crawley schemas — v2.1 uses runtime envelopes, NOT typed Zod), D-V21.18-.23 (Wave-E contract pin only — no engine code in v2.1).

### Step 2: Spawn 6 teammates

`migrations-and-agent-audit` runs FIRST (blocks all other TA1 agents until EC-V21-A.0 green). After its tag posts, `project-artifacts-table` + `langgraph-wirer` + `open-questions-emitter` run in parallel. `verifier` blocks on those three. `docs` blocks on `verifier`.

## TA2 — c1v-synthesis-ui (Wave A)

**Scope:** All 18 React components for the synthesis UX + nav-config rewrite + archive pages + the merged Architecture & Database section with alternative-picker + DBML approval gate. Reuses existing brand tokens (`app/theme.css` + `app/globals.css`: Firefly/Porcelain/Tangerine/Danube) + existing shadcn/ui primitives + existing layout patterns from `components/projects/sections/*.tsx`, `components/system-design/*.tsx`, `components/chat/*.tsx`, `components/diagrams/diagram-viewer.tsx` per EC-V21-A.11 (no Figma blocker, locked 2026-04-25 16:06 EDT). Per D-V21.17, NO canned exemplar — pre-synthesis state is empty-state CTA.

**Dependencies:** SOFT-depends on TA1's project_artifacts table shape (consumes via `@/lib/db/schema`) and chat-bridge ledger keys (`extractedData.openQuestions.{requirements|qfdResolved|riskResolved}`). Both are typed exports from TA1 — TA2's components import the types and consume; tests use TA2's own fixtures so TA2 can land in parallel with TA1's runtime work.

**Honors:** D-V21.03 (React shell + raw Mermaid), D-V21.11 (bundle ZIP UX), D-V21.15 (FMEA route promotion to nav), D-V21.17 (no canned exemplar).

## TA3 — c1v-cloudrun-sidecar (Wave A)

**Scope:** Python sidecar for long-running synthesis pipeline (D-V21.02 hybrid) — orchestrator.py + Dockerfile + Cloud Run config + `mmdc` Mermaid PNG pre-render dependency. Runs the canonical Python generators (`gen-arch-recommendation.py`, `gen-qfd.py`, `gen-fmea.py`, etc.) that produced the c1v self-application — same code path produces every tenant project. weasyprint for PDF (D-V21.05) + python-pptx for PPTX (D-V21.06) + Supabase Storage signed URLs (D-V21.08). Three API routes: POST /synthesize (deducts 1000 credits per D-V21.10, fires Cloud Run, returns 202), GET /synthesize/status (polls per-artifact synthesis_status), POST /api/projects/[id]/artifacts/manifest extension (extends existing route with PDF/PPTX/Bundle URLs from project_artifacts). BullMQ deferred per D-V21 — Cloud Run hosts the long pipeline, Vercel triggers + polls.

**Dependencies:** SOFT-depends on TA1's project_artifacts table (writes synthesis_status from sidecar; queries from API routes). Coordinated via name-based blocking inside Wave A.

**Honors:** D-V21.02, D-V21.05, D-V21.06, D-V21.07, D-V21.08, D-V21.10, R-V21.02 (Mermaid PNG pre-render), R-V21.12 (cold-start warm-up).

## TB1 — c1v-hardening (Wave B)

**Scope:** Make per-tenant gen affordable + reliable + observable per v2.1 Wave B. Cache (`inputs_hash` cache hit > 30%), lazy-gen (defer 4-of-7 artifacts to first viewer hit), tier gating (Free=1/mo, Plus∞), circuit breaker (30s timeout → per-artifact retry CTA, NO canned fall-back), Sentry observability (latency p95, token cost/day, failure rate per agent). Cost ceiling: ≤ $500/mo at 100 DAU baseline (down from Wave-A unoptimized $924/mo).

**Dependencies:** HARD-DEP on `ta1-wave-a-complete` + `ta2-wave-a-complete` + `ta3-wave-a-complete` (Wave-A gate). TD1's `td1-wave-d-complete` is NOT a TB1 gate — Wave D ships independently.

**Honors:** D-V21.10 (credit gating), R-V21.05 (cost overshoot mitigation), R-V21.11 (UX cliff via lazy-gen), R-V21.12 (cold-start), EC-V21-B.1-.6.

## TD1 — c1v-apispec-iter3 (Wave D, parallel with Wave A)

Step D-0 preflight (capture stop_reason); branch on result; ship two-stage extraction.

## Wave gate procedure (git-tag mechanism)

Same mechanism as v2 §14.3 (per-team verifier tags + Bond polls). v2.1-specific tag matrix:

1. **Team verifier tags.** Each team's `verifier` agent creates a git tag `t<slug>-wave-<wave>-complete` on the commit where all team ECs pass. No tag = team not done. Tags:
   - TA1 → `ta1-wave-a-complete`
   - TA2 → `ta2-wave-a-complete`
   - TA3 → `ta3-wave-a-complete`
   - TB1 → `tb1-wave-b-complete`
   - TD1 → `td1-wave-d-complete`
2. **Wave-gate condition.** Bond advances from one dispatch wave to the next iff ALL required tags are present on `origin/main`. v2.1 dispatch waves:
   - **Dispatch Wave 1 (Wave A + D fire together):** TA1 + TA2 + TA3 + TD1 — required tags for advancing: `ta1-wave-a-complete` AND `ta2-wave-a-complete` AND `ta3-wave-a-complete`. (TD1 is parallel/independent — Bond surfaces TD1's tag as a separate ship signal but does NOT gate Wave 2 on it.)
   - **Dispatch Wave 2 (Wave B):** TB1 — terminal. No further dispatch. v2.1 ships when `tb1-wave-b-complete` lands AND TD1 has shipped (or TD1 surfaces as an open follow-up if it hasn't, but doesn't block the v2.1 doc-flip).
3. **Optional human gate.** If David sets tag `wave-a-approved` manually (via `git tag wave-a-approved <sha> && git push --tags`), Bond blocks Wave 2 dispatch on its presence in addition to the verifier tags. If David does not set it, verifier-tag-only path auto-advances.
4. **TD1 ship signal.** TD1 carries no Wave-2 gate. When `td1-wave-d-complete` lands, Bond surfaces a one-line "TD1 shipped — iter-3 fix live behind feature flag" notification. If TD1 hasn't tagged by the time Wave-2 closes, plan-updater (TB1.docs) captures it as an open v2.1 follow-up.
5. **Polling.** `git fetch --tags && git tag --list 't*-wave-*-complete'` every 270 seconds via `ScheduleWakeup` (handoff Issue 19 — 270s keeps the prompt cache warm; 300s is the worst-of-both-worlds boundary that pays the cache-miss without amortizing it). When all required tags present, Bond dispatches next wave in a single coordinator message. After 30 min of idle polling with no tag movement, optionally back off to 1200s (one cache miss buys 20+ min of further idle). If 60 min elapsed without all tags, Bond surfaces "Wave stuck — missing tags: X, Y" to David.
6. **Rollback.** Each team's first agent that modifies state creates a snapshot tag (`t<slug>-pre-wave-a-snapshot` or similar). Rollback = `git checkout <tag> -- <scoped-path>`.

---

## Dispatch order (canonical, copy-paste sequence)

**Mechanism:** All `TeamCreate` + `Agent` calls for a single dispatch wave fire in ONE coordinator message to maximize parallelism. v2 dropped the prior 2-min stagger; v2.1 inherits.

### Dispatch Wave 1 (4 teams, 20 agents — single message)

```
# One coordinator message contains:
TeamCreate(c1v-runtime-wiring)     + 6× Agent  # TA1
TeamCreate(c1v-synthesis-ui)       + 6× Agent  # TA2
TeamCreate(c1v-cloudrun-sidecar)   + 4× Agent  # TA3
TeamCreate(c1v-apispec-iter3)      + 4× Agent  # TD1
```

Internal sequencing within teams:
- TA1: `migrations-and-agent-audit` BLOCKS the other 5 TA1 agents (EC-V21-A.0 preflight is sequential).
- TA2: all 4 producer agents parallel; verifier blocks on producers; docs blocks on verifier.
- TA3: 2 producer agents parallel; verifier + docs after.
- TD1: `preflight-and-stage1-schema` BLOCKS `stage2-deterministic-expansion` (stage-1 schema must exist before stage-2 imports it); verifier + docs after.

### Wave-A Gate (verifier polling, no manual approval required)

After Bond observes `ta1-wave-a-complete` AND `ta2-wave-a-complete` AND `ta3-wave-a-complete` on `origin/main`, dispatch Wave 2.
TD1's `td1-wave-d-complete` is surfaced as a ship signal but does NOT gate Wave 2.

### Dispatch Wave 2 (1 team, 5 agents — single message)

```
TeamCreate(c1v-hardening) + 5× Agent  # TB1
```

Internal sequencing within TB1: 3 producer agents parallel; verifier blocks on producers; docs blocks on verifier (and writes the v2.1 release notes + plan closeout).

### Total

**5 teams · 25 agents · 2 dispatch waves.** Estimated 8-14 days wall-clock (Wave A 5-7 days realistic / 8-12 days conservative per critique iter-1; Wave B 3-5 days post-Wave-A; Wave D parallel with Wave A).

---

## Dispatch blockers (must resolve before Dispatch Wave 1)

### Resolved

1. ✅ Master plan v2.1 scope cut applied 2026-04-25 16:31 EDT — Waves C + E deferred to v2.2; v2.1 ships A + B + D only.
2. ✅ Visual-style locked — EC-V21-A.11 (no Figma blocker); reuse existing brand tokens + components per locked 2026-04-25 16:06 EDT.
3. ✅ Empty-state locked — D-V21.17 (no canned exemplar); per-tenant from day one.
4. ✅ Wave A ↔ Wave E handshake locked — `nfr_engine_contract_version: 'v1'` envelope on `GENERATE_nfr` / `GENERATE_constants` outputs; `system-question-bridge.ts` ships in v2.1 (TA1) as shared transport; `surface-gap.ts` producer deferred to v2.2.
5. ✅ Subagent_type permissions — every type used (backend-architect, database-engineer, langchain-engineer, ui-ux-engineer, data-viz-engineer, devops-engineer, cache-engineer, observability-engineer, qa-engineer, documentation-engineer) is in the `.claude/settings.json` allow-list (verified 2026-04-25).
6. ✅ Skill-attachment mechanism — `inline_skills: [...]` translates to `Skill()` calls at dispatch time per v2 convention.
7. ✅ Migration collision (0011_kb_chunks.sql + 0011_decision_audit.sql) — assigned to TA1.migrations-and-agent-audit as EC-V21-A.0 preflight.
8. ✅ Path-claim defects (`lib/langgraph/intake-graph.ts` doesn't exist; canonical is `lib/langchain/graphs/intake-graph.ts`) — assigned to TA1.migrations-and-agent-audit + enforced in TA1.langgraph-wirer guardrails.
9. ✅ FROZEN UI components — listed in apps/product-helper/CLAUDE.md `UI Freeze` table; TA2 verifier asserts no modifications.
10. ✅ Every team has both QA and Documentation roles per David's 2026-04-25 16:45 EDT directive — verifier (qa-engineer) + docs (documentation-engineer) per team.

### Resolved David rulings (locked 2026-04-25 19:50 EDT)

- ✅ **R-v2.1.A** Wave A timeline — **Option C resolved**: keep 5-7 day target with explicit fail-forward semantic per handoff Issue 5 — any agent fs-side-effects refactor >200 LOC ships as a graph-node-adapter wrapper in v2.1; underlying refactor defers to v2.2 day-0. Documented in TA1.langgraph-wirer guardrails. No A1/A2 split.
- ✅ **R-v2.1.B** Chat-bridge — **Bond default held**: folded into TA1.open-questions-emitter.
- ✅ **R-v2.1.C** Sidecar + API routes — **Bond default held**: together in TA3.
- ✅ **R-v2.1.D** Cost ceiling — **Confirmed $500/mo at 100 DAU as v2.1 ship gate** (handoff Group E ruling). EC-V21-B.6 pinned to ≤ $500/mo. Free-tier hard-cap (1 synthesis/mo) is the structural backstop during the Wave-A unoptimized window. AV.01 portfolio-keystone alignment ($320/mo) carries to v2.2 (Wave E heuristic-engine cost lever) — tracked in plans/post-v2.1-followups.md.
- ~~**R-v2.1.E** Methodology-correction canonical path~~ — **2026-04-25 LOCK REVOKED 2026-04-26.** Original lock asserted `plans/kb-upgrade-v2/METHODOLOGY-CORRECTION.md` and `.claude/plans/kb-upgrade-v2/METHODOLOGY-CORRECTION.md` existed at 34126 bytes — neither does on disk. The handoff fact-check missed `system-design/kb-upgrade-v2/METHODOLOGY-CORRECTION.md` (correct path includes the `kb-upgrade-v2/` subdir; handoff was checking `system-design/METHODOLOGY-CORRECTION.md` — different path). Canonical home is now `system-design/kb-upgrade-v2/METHODOLOGY-CORRECTION.md` (only intact copy + co-located with only complete 1-8 module tree). See `plans/v21-outputs/ta1/methodology-canonical.md`.

### Still open (plan-doc work before Dispatch Wave 1)

- [ ] Master plan v2.1 (`plans/c1v-MIT-Crawley-Cornell.v2.1.md`) flipped DRAFT → ready-for-execution. Currently DRAFT awaiting David's review.
- [ ] This spawn-prompts doc reviewed and approved (post-fix-up critique iter 2 — optional).
- [x] Five R-v2.1 rulings above resolved (locked 2026-04-25 19:50 EDT; A=Option C / B=held / C=held / D=confirm $500 / E=non-decision).

**Dispatch unblocked when:** Master plan ready-for-execution + this doc approved (or fix-up sweep accepted as-is).
